# blood-bank-donator-system
This project was completely developed in Python when I was in Costa Rica during a semester in college. 
I created with another student a blood bank donator system that contains an internal "database" (binary file) that stores the blood donators.
It contains the functions of:
  -Inserting a donator: requests data to the user, such as id, full name, birthday, type of blood, gender, weight, phone number, and email.
  -Generate donators
  -Update data of the donator
