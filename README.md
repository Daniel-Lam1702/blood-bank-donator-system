# blood-bank-donator-system
# This project was completely developed in Python when I was in Costa Rica during a semester in college. The interface was created with the library Tkinter.
# I created with another student a blood bank donator system that contains an internal "database" (binary file) that stores the blood donators.
# It contains the functions of:
#  -Inserting a donator: requests data to the user, such as id, full name, birthday, type of blood, gender, weight, phone number, and email. (like a POST request)
#  -Generate donators 
#  -Update data of the donator (PUT)
#  -Delete the donator (DELETE)
#  -Create an Excel spreadsheet with the donors according to certain filters established by the user.
# 
# This project simulates a REST app on a low scale.
